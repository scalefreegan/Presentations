# Toolchains for integrating heterogeneous algorithms and data: an anecdote

Integration of heterogeneous data and algorithms is increasingly common in systems biology workflows. We recently developed a [system-level model for transcriptional control](http://egrin2.systemsbiology.net/) from high-throughput datasets for two prokaryotes. By combining several types of biological data, prior biological knowledge, an ensemble of learning algorithms and a multistep post-processing procedure into a [single toolchain](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/baliga-lab/egrin2-tools/blob/master/doc/index.ipynb) we were able to reverse engineer a gene regulatory network containing nearly 3X as many known interactions compared to other state-of-the-art methods. My talk will focus on methodologies for data and algorithm integration within the context of this example. However, rather than outline the details of each method in the toolchain, I will instead use them as an example to motivate discussion about building more general approaches to combine high-throughput datasets and reconcile predictions from diverse algorithms.
