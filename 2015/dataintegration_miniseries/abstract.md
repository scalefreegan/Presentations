Integration of heterogenous data and algorithms is increasingly common in systems biology workflows. We recently developed a [system-level model for transcriptional control](http://egrin2.systemsbiology.net/) from high-throughput datasets for two prokaryotes. By combining several types of biological data, an ensemble of algorithms, and a multistep post-processing procedure into a [single toolchain](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/baliga-lab/egrin2-tools/blob/master/doc/index.ipynb) we were able to infer a gene regulatory network with nearly 3X as many known interactions. In this talk I will through . Rather than, I will try to how these tools can be leveraged to and reconcile diverse learning algorithms. In addition, I will highlight models with genome-scale models of metabolism.
