Integration of heterogenous data and algorithms is increasingly common in systems biology workflows. We recently developed a [system-level model for transcriptional control](http://egrin2.systemsbiology.net/) from high-troughput datasets for two prokaryotes. By combined several types of biological data,  and a multistep post-processing procedure into a single toolchain we were able to infer . In this talk I will through . Rather than, I will try to how these tools can be leveraged to and reconcile. In addition, I will highlight models with genome-scale models of metabolism.
